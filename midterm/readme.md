#Midterm: The Magic Box

Magic box is an exploration between movement and sensory awareness. The purpose of the box is to respond to its environment and the people around it. Through a motion sensor, the box monitors its surroundings, reacting to ambient activity, and a user’s proximity.

The user will first begin by asking a question. When the user moves his/her hand over the sensors, the colors of the lights change to either blue or white. White indicating the answer is no and blue indicating the answer is yes.

The goal is to create an experience that is dynamic and engaging, one in which the user can make connections between his/her movements and the box’s response.

##The Process

I began by first working on the box. It helped me to define the scale and jump-start material experimentation. I sanded the box to give the ilusion of a magic 8 ball so the user won't focus on the lights but on the outcome of their question.

Afterwards, I wanted to test the motion sensor in correlation with the LEDs.

Afterwards, I worked on some possibilities between the motion sensor and the LEDs.
