#Midterm: The Magic Box

Magic box is an exploration between movement and sensory awareness. The purpose of the box is to respond to its environment and the people around it. Through a motion sensor, the box monitors its surroundings, reacting to ambient activity, and a user’s proximity.

The user will first begin by asking a question. When the user moves his/her hand over the sensors, the colors of the lights change to either blue or white. White indicating the answer is no and blue indicating the answer is yes.

The goal is to create an experience that is dynamic and engaging, one in which the user can make connections between his/her movements and the box’s response.

##Equipment:

* Arduino Uno
* Parallax PIR Motion Sensor
* Mini Breadboard
* USB A to B Cable
* 2 5mm LEDS (Blue and White)
* 2 220 ohm resistors
* 9 Solderless Breadboard Jumper Wires

##The Process

I began by first working on the box. It helped me to define the scale and jump-start material experimentation. I sanded the box to give the ilusion of a magic 8 ball so the user won't focus on the lights.

Afterwards, I tested the photoresistor with the LEDs. I noticed the only way the LEDs turn on is by touching the photoresistor. This wasn't going to work since I did not want the user to touch the sensor. I researched another solution and found the Parallax Motion Sensor. Once I connected all the wires, I wanted to test the LEDs in correlation with the motion sensor.

Afterwards, I worked on some possibilities between the motion sensor and the LEDs.
