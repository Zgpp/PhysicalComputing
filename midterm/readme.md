#Midterm: The Motion Box

####I wanted to explore movement and sensory awareness, which responded to its environment and the people around it. Through a network of sensors, the box monitors its surroundings, reacting to ambient activity, and a user’s proximity. 

####The goal is to create an experience that is dynamic and engaging, one in which the user can make connections between his/her movements and the object’s response.

####As the user moves his/her hand over the box the colors of the lights change. The next step would be to add sound to the user's movement.
