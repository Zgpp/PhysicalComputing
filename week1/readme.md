#Cleaning Machine 

It's already installed in your home. It cleans while you run errands, go to work or school. The idea is to save yourself time and provide everyone a tool they can use to keep their homes clean. It's available for all families of lower and middle class income as well.

I want the machine to be user-friendly. Not have so many buttons just 

* Wash
* Dry
* Fold

Somehow within the heating and cooling system built into the home there would be a connection for the cleaning machine.
