#Cleaning Machine 

It's already installed in your home. It cleans while you run errands, go to work or school. The idea is to save yourself time and provide everyone a tool they can use to keep their homes clean. It will be available for all families of upper, middle and lower class.

I want the machine to be user-friendly. The buttons available would be: 

* Wash
* Dry
* Fold
**Possibly adding an on or off button, to save energy.

The connection will be through the heating and cooling wires that are built into the home.
